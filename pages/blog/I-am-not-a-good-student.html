        &#9;Being a student of Computer Science isn't exactly a smooth sail for me.
        There is ups and down, and many times, I blew up my CGPA.<br>
        There is one important thing that I noticed:
        <blockquote>
          Computer Science course is not what I expected
        </blockquote>
      </p>

      <p>
        &#9;That is where things get hairy, I am not a genius for maths, I am not
        fond of programming, I picked Computer Science course because when I am
        choosing a university course, pretty much everything else is ruled out
        for me, I won't be a lawyer, I won't be a Mechanical Engineer, not
        a physicist, and absolutely not a doctor. <br>
        What I do thought about is being a professional gamer, or just doing something
        that involves me playing games all day, heck, maybe there is even something else
        that I don't even remember.
      </p>

      <p>
        &#9;So I picked Computer Science, because, well it's about computers and I loved meddling
        with computers and I don't think I am going to choose anything else. <br>
        I went through studies with databases, programmings, data structures, algorithms.
        There are times where I don't even know what I am doing, I would literally memorize
        everything and get done with the exams.
      </p>

      <p>
        &#9;Well what happen after that? Did I change course? No. Many might think I should have.
        Something interesting happened, I found out that I actually liked Artificial Intelligence,
        Machine Learning and Data Science a lot. I started dive deeper into these fields and started
        to make sense of application of math. Why this happened? Turns out, I played a game called
        Deus Ex, and there was an AI Character in the game that contacts the protagonist and help
        the protagonist to fight off bad guys. I thought, what if I could create something like that?<br>
        At first, I thought I was'nt meant for Artificial Intelligence because I scored quite bad at that subject,
        nevertheless, after exploring around the field of CS, I still think that AI/ML and DS is the best thing for me,
        I might not excel as the brilliant guys, but I know I can do something with it.
      </p>

      <p>
        &#9;<b>If you think you picked the wrong course, especially if you picked CS,</b> here is some advice from me,
        <strong>find what you love within what you don't like</strong>, it's not easy, it involves months or even years
        of exploration. There is something you can always do with Computer Science and programming, AND if you
        used your knowledge in CS/Programming to do something you love and no one has ever done it before, THIS IS WHERE
        INNOVATION HAPPENS.
      </p>

      <h2>How to relate what you love with Computer Science</h2>
      <p>
        First, identify what you like.<br>
        Second, and the most important part is:<br>
        <strong>Relate what you love with Computer Science</strong><br>
        For example, if you love drawing, draw some good characters and make a game for them!<br>
        If you love the nature, discover how computers and data science are able to help you preserve the ecosystem.<br>
        If you love music, learn how to make good musics with computers, or generate music with AI.<br>
        If you love writing, learn how to build a beautiful website for your articles!<br>
        And finally, learn whatever it takes to make them happen you might fail, you might never succeed,
        but eventually, you will discover other things that you like.<br>
        And the best case is: you made a revolution in the IT Industry by creating something new and unique!<br>
      </p>

      <p>
        The main take away from this is that adoption of computers are increasing, there are
        endless creative ways you can use it. Even if you might not like programming or Computer Science,
        there is always something you can do with programming and computer science. <br>
        Don't feel sad or discouraged by the thought of choosing the wrong course, because
        I know you can do something great with it. <br>
        Last but not least, I wish you have a great journey ahead!<br>
