          <p>
              <q>Where are we heading?</q><br>

              &#9;The only honest answer I can tell is:<br>
              I don't know.

              &#9;Now before you clicking away, I would like to point out a few things
              that may give is some hints or a general direction on where our computer
              technology is heading, I'll start with a few hot topics <br>
          </p>

                      <h3>Artificial Intelligence(AI)</h3><br>
                      <p>
                        &#9;This is a hot one, especially on multiple news that exposes how
                        corporates collects and use data to train their algorithms(or AI) to
                        produce products that does predictions and smart functions from object
                        recognitions to self-driving cars.<br>
                        &#9;A lot of research surrounding AI is going on the academia and corporates,
                        which is surrounding on making AI(Neural Networks are studied the most nowadays)
                        to get well trained on less data. Let's face it, AI is still not that smart,
                        they have to look at thousands or even millions of pictures of cars in
                        order to properly recognize a car and you(yes you) don't have to even look more
                        than 3(or 5, or 10) cars to recognize that it's a car. <br>
                        &#9;With research going on this direction, AI will get stronger in the future and
                        smaller companies or developers, don't have to rely on gigantic datasets(which
                        takes up a lot of space) to develop smart applications. <br>
                        &#9;With that being said, AI is only going to be more powerful when we have
                        better Unsupervised Learning algorithms, which save even more of developer's
                        work to categorize datas.<br>
                        &#9;One side note that AI goes hand in hand with Big Data and Data Science, they
                        relies on each other to produce results. Although there are differences between them
                        they are quite related to each other.
                      </p>

                      <h3>Internet of Things(IoT)</h3><br>
                      <p>
                      &#9;It's already happening, as devices get smaller, more powerful at a cheaper price,
                      we are able to create more automated, connected, smart products and devices. The
                      smartphone that are potentially have a few, or even a few tenths, times more processing
                      powers than a Supercomputer 40 or 30 years ago, for the sake of comparison,
                      Deep Blue(1997) delivers 11.38 Gflops and the GPU in a Snapdragon 835 could deliver
                      567 Gflops. <br>
                      &#9;When computers are used everywhere, security becomes a concern, because you don't want to tell
                      someone that the security of your bread toaster are compromised, or worse,hackers hacking into
                      a nuclear reactor or power generators and overheat it. <br>
                      This make cybersecurity a good field to be involved in. In the future, cybersecurity may be
                      incorporated with AI methodolgies in order to optimize security protection. AI will be used in
                      anomaly detections and learning sucipicious behaviors, heck, or even train an AI to do penentration
                      tests!<br>

                      <h3>Decentralization</h3><br>
                      <p>
                      &#9;I bet you might never heard of this word, but if you do, you might just be a geek like I am. But you
                      probably heard of the word "Blockchain", and yes, it's a big hype, but to be honest, it's not a ground
                      breaking technology but sure does it is a simple, brilliant idea to be used today considering computers
                      today are more connected than ever.<br>
                      &#9;The internet today is decentralized, and it have some problems, considering your some of the information
                      are unexpectedly lost and presented to you as the infamous "404 Error". A simple mistake in the location
                      of the file can give you nothing in turn, and this is not very logical, let me explain.<br>
                      &#9;So, you have a book that you like to read, say, "Harry Potter", you know there is one copy of the book
                      at National Library of England(or any where in ther world across the globe from your current position), rack
                      number 254. Now you go all the way to National Library of England, find rack number 254 and read the book.<br>
                      "Wait... what?" you say, and yup, that does'nt make sense, right? <br>
                      What if the book is moved to National Library of Italy? <br>
                      What if the book is taken away by some one and placed at rack 107? <br>
                      Do you do that? <br>
                      &#9;Or Do you ask your nearest friends around, or the nearest bookshop to look for a copy of Harry Potter? <br>
                      Yup, that's what decentralization means and how file systems like IPFS(InterPlanetary File System) works, in contrast
                      of HTTP protocol, instead going to the location, you ask your nearest node in the network for the contents you want. <br>
                      &#9;Currently IPFS is being actively developed and some developers are looking for ways how to best utilize IPFS,
                      including giving rewards for peoples with computers selling their extra hard-disk storage, with the exchange of
                      some cryptocurrencies(At the current moment, I know FileCoin does this), the feasibility of this method is still
                      undergoing discussions, and most people would'nt want to do the extra work to replace the already well establish HTTP
                      protocol, but this is an interesting idea to explore on, maybe you can create something great with it, who know? <br>
                      &#9;Of course there are more benefits of decentralization, but it is another topic for another day.
                      </p>

                      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                      <p>
                        &#9;Now you see the possible futures of the IT world, where do you stand? Where WILL you stand? It's a whole new
                        world out there for you to explore!
