          <p>
              <q>Where are we heading?</q><br>

              &#9;The only honest answer I can tell is:<br>
              I don't know.

              &#9;Now before you clicking away, I would like to point out a few things
              that may give is some hints or a general direction on where our computer
              technology is heading, I'll start with a few hot topics <br>
          </p>

                      <h3>Artificial Intelligence(AI)</h3><br>
                      <p>
                        This is a hot one, especially on multiple news that exposes how
                        corporates collects and use data to train their algorithms(or AI) to
                        produce products that does predictions and smart functions from object
                        recognitions to self-driving cars.<br>
                        A lot of research surrounding AI is going on the academia and corporates,
                        which is surrounding on making AI(Neural Networks are studied the most nowadays)
                        to get well trained on less data. Let's face it, AI is still not that smart,
                        they have to look at thousands or even millions of pictures of cars in
                        order to properly recognize a car and you(yes you) don't have to even look more
                        than 3(or 5, or 10) cars to recognize that it's a car. <br>
                        With research going on this direction, AI will get stronger in the future and
                        smaller companies or developers, don't have to rely on gigantic datasets(which
                        takes up a lot of space) to develop smart applications. <br>
                        With that being said, AI is only going to be more powerful when we have
                        better Unsupervised Learning algorithms, which save even more of developer's
                        work to categorize datas.
                      </p>

                      <h3>Internet of Things(IoT)</h3><br>
                      <p>
                      &#9;It's already happening, as devices get smaller, more powerful at a cheaper price,
                      we are able to create more automated, connected, smart products and devices. The
                      smartphone that are potentially have a few, or even a few tenths, times more processing
                      powers than a Supercomputer 40 or 30 years ago, for the sake of comparison,
                      Deep Blue(1997) delivers 11.38 Gflops and the GPU in a Snapdragon 835 could deliver
                      567 Gflops. <br>
                      When computers are used everywhere, security becomes a concern, because you don't want someone to
                      hack into your smart-home system and turn on all the lights, or worse, hacking into a nuclear reactor
                      or power generators and overheat it. <br>
                      This make cybersecurity a good field to be involved in. In the future, cybersecurity may be
                      incorporated with AI methodolgies in order to optimize security protection. AI will be used in
                      anomaly detections and learning sucipicious behaviors, heck, or even train an AI to do penentration
                      tests!
                      </p>
