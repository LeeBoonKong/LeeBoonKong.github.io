      <p>I want to learn HTML5 and web building this website</p>
      <p>
        My main interest is Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning.
        and Data Science, they are my goals and passion for Computer Science.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, Web and App is how these ideas in Data Science and Artificial
        Intelligence applied, that is why I want to venture into app and web
        design to communicate my interest and applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you can see this website is pretty crappy for now, and my end goals
        of learning HTML5(HTML, CSS and Javascript Stack,would posibly power
        the backend APIs with Python), is to make this
        website beautiful and populate it with helpful features that could
        inspre more, help more, learn more and share more.
        So if you had just started your journey too in anything to become a
        better self,
        <blockquote>
          <hr />
          <h3>
            I wish you well on your journey to greatness <br />
            May we become better together!
          </h3>
          <hr />
